//This is used as import or main file


// import { apikey } from ".//Users/technext/Documents/React_files_learn/Js-refresher/import.js"; // Corrected path and removed extra semicolon

//for the second method we can use to get the api key by exporting and it feels more right 

import apikey from "./import.js"; 

console.log(apikey);


//To use any module as an object or packeage we can ue by :  
/* import * as import from "./import.js" */

//use case :  console.log(import.tanju);
